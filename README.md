# A Wizard-of-Oz Home Notification mockup

This quick-and-dirty prototype was designed to run an Experience Lab with the 
[DHI](https://dhi-scotland.com/)/[GSA](http://gsadesigninnovation.com/) 
to explore acceptability and response to a digital home-wide notification system for 
elderly citizens in home care. 

## Notes

+ All resources have benn added inline, as the system should be able to run offline.
  Sorry for the overload :-)
  
+ A Text-To-Speech engine (MaryTTS) needs to be deployed on the system and running on its own local 
  server in order to provide speech notification. The URL is hardcoded in the system
  (check definition of /marytts routes).
